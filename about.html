      <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
      <p>I am a Georgia native, living in Chicago for the last 4 years. After graduating with a business degree in Marketing and New Media Technology,  I began my career in software sales at a high-growth startup, where I spent my days helping technical team members with complex search use cases across all verticals and industries.<br><br>

        I am passionate about equality in healthcare and wellness for women and working parents. I am the Chapter President for the Chicago PERIOD Movement, where we advocate for menstrual equity, ending stigma, and aid homeless populations in getting access to the products they need. I am also serve on the board at Between Friends where we assist victims of domestic violence in court processes.<br><br>
        
        I'm currently enrolled in the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp, with an expected graduation of date January 2022. I am keen to marry my experience in the tech industry with my passion for women's healthcare, and hope to one day be able to help build technologies for the FemTech space. </p>
